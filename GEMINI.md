Doc strings should be minimal. One sentence maximum. Do not comment on what each of the args/returns/methods/attributes of a function/class are.

Inline comments (#) should be entirely lowercase aside from for proper nouns. Doc strings do not follow this, function doc strings should be all on one line and encapsulated with one sentence, i.e., """xyz""". Class doc strings should take the format """\nxyz\n""". In both cases, doc string should be properly capitalised. 

Never request to automatically change code, make human language suggestions at what should be implemented instead, giving written code examples where necessary. 

On startup, make sure to read through the entire project taking particular note of the overall structure and design.
