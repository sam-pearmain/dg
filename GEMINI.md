Doc strings should be minimal. One sentence maximum. Do not comment on what each of the args/returns/methods/attributes of a function/class are.

Inline comments (#) should be entirely lowercase aside from for proper nouns. Doc strings do not follow this, they are as normal.

Do not automatically change code, prefer to make human language suggestions at what should be implemented giving code only where necessary. 

On startup, make sure to read through the entire project taking particular note of the overall structure and design.
